## 1.5 Problem Statement

Despite significant advancements in fraud detection technologies, financial institutions continue to face substantial challenges in accurately identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. The core problem addressed in this research can be articulated as follows:

**Current fraud detection systems in banking suffer from limited adaptability to evolving fraud patterns, high false positive rates, and inadequate scalability for processing the increasing volume and velocity of financial transactions.**

This overarching problem manifests in several specific challenges:

1. **Detection Latency**: Existing systems often involve batch processing that introduces delays in fraud detection, increasing the window of vulnerability between a fraudulent transaction and its detection.

2. **Limited Pattern Recognition**: Rule-based systems and traditional machine learning approaches struggle to identify complex, evolving fraud patterns that have not been previously observed or encoded as rules.

3. **Scalability Constraints**: As transaction volumes grow exponentially, many detection systems face performance degradation and increasing operational costs.

4. **Class Imbalance Management**: The extreme rarity of fraudulent transactions (typically <0.1% of all transactions) poses significant modeling challenges, often resulting in models biased toward the majority class.

5. **Integration Complexity**: Implementing advanced detection methods in production banking environments involves substantial technical challenges in integrating with legacy systems and meeting strict operational requirements.

This research addresses these challenges through an integrated approach that combines the distributed processing capabilities of Apache Spark with the pattern recognition power of deep learning techniques. The proposed solution aims to deliver a scalable, adaptive, and accurate fraud detection system that can operate effectively in high-volume banking environments.
