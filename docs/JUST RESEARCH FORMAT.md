## 1.0 INTRODUCTION Contents

In the process of completing an academic program in Jamhuriya University of Science and
Technology (JUST) and being awarded the specific degree, a candidate is required to submit a
graduation project, dissertation or a thesis, depending on the requirements of the specific program.
In view of this requirement, the academic department, Jamhuriya University of Science and
Technology has taken the initiative to provide general guidelines for the submission of research
reports, dissertations and theses. These guidelines will assist students to meet the minimal format
requirements set by the University to complete the final form of a graduation project, dissertation
or thesis. Each individual faculty may have its own additional format requirements.

## 2.0 ORDER OF CONTENTS

The structure of the research report or dissertation is based on a standard format which contains the
following sections:
Preface
Supplementary

### 2.1. Preface

This section consists of the following:

### 2.1.1 Title Page

The title page is the first page after the front cover and should include the research title which has
been approved by the faculty, name of candidate according to the registration records, and the
statement “...submission of research report/dissertation/thesis for the fulfillment of the Degree of
Bachelor of .../ Master of .../Doctor of Philosophy” and finally the year of submission. Refer to
Appendix A for example of front cover and the title page.

#### 2.1.2 Original Literary Work Declaration

This subsection is compulsory. Please refer to the format given in Appendix B.

#### 2.1.3 Abstract

Generally, the abstract is written after the completion of the text of the dissertation/thesis. It
summarizes the structure of the whole text and the major facts it contains. It should be written in
the language of the research report/dissertation/thesis and contain no more than 400 words. The
abstract should be placed on the page immediately after the title page.

#### 2.1.4 Acknowledgements

This is a special subsection to convey appreciation to those who have been involved in the study.

#### 2.1.5 Table of Contents

The Table of Contents lists the chapters, topics and sub-topics together with their page numbers.
Sub-topics and topics should be labeled according to the chapter, for e.g., the first topic in Chapter 1

should be marked 1.1 and the first sub-topic, 1.1.1. The use of letters in parenthesis for e.g., (a), (b),
(c) is appropriate as a means of differentiating sub-topics of the same topic.

#### 2.1.6 List of Figures

This list contains the titles of figures, together with their page numbers, which are listed in the text.
For e.g., figures in Chapter 3 are numbered sequentially: Figure 3.1, Figure 3.2.

#### 2.1.7 List of Tables

This list contains the titles of tables, together with their page numbers, which are listed in the text.
The numbering system is according to chapter, for e.g.: tables in Chapter 3 are numbered

collect the data and generate the findings reported.

#### 2.2.4 Results

Results are commonly presented in the form of text, figures and tables, complete with data analysis.

#### 2.2.5 Discussion

spine of the hardbound manuscripts should show the title, author, year of submission and type of
degree.

navy blue for medical and engineering faculties and dark red for business and IT faculties and
maroon for other faculties. The letters for the Front Cover should be printed in gold of font size 15,
font type Times New Roman and in uppercase letters.

#### 4.2 Length..............................................................................................................................................

The length (excluding footnotes, appendices, tables and prefaces) for a submission for
examination:

Research Report: 15,000 – 20,000 words
Approved research reports/dissertations/theses or parts of their content are allowed for publication
if they are accompanied by a statement that the work was conducted towards the fulfillment of a
particular degree. A candidate, is strongly encouraged to publish papers based on the work during
his or her course of study, and due reference must be made to the University in all such papers.

#### 4.3 Paper and Duplicating

Manuscripts should be printed on high quality A4 paper (201 X 297 mm; 80 grams). Computer pin-
feed printout paper is not permitted. The final manuscript, in hardbound copies, must be typed and
duplicated by offset printing or good quality photocopying. All copies must be clean and neat in
order to ensure easy reading.

#### 4.4 Printing

#### 4.4.1 Printing Quality

Sections must be typed using Times New Roman, font size 12. For mathematical texts, the use of
Equation Editor or Latex is advisable. Script fonts are not permitted. A high-quality laser or ink-jet
printer should be used for the printing.

#### 4.4.2 Line Spacing

The body of the text should be typed with double spacing. Single-spacing is only permitted in tables,
long quotations, footnotes, citation and in the bibliography.

#### 4.5 Margins

The text should have the following margins:

Right: 2.0 cm
Left: 4.0 cm
Bottom: 2.0 cm
Additional guidelines need to be followed:
Do not type more than one sentence after the bottom margin. If it is necessary to do so, it should
only be for a footnote or the completion of the last sentence of the chapter, topic or sub-topic or
information in a figure.
All tables and figures must be placed within the specified margins.
The last paragraph of the page should contain at least two sentences. If it does not, the paragraph
should begin on the next page.

#### 4.6 Page Numbering

All page numbers should be printed 1.0 cm from the bottom margin and placed at the right-hand
side without any punctuation.
Font size 8 recommended for numbers.

Roman numerals (i, ii, iii etc.) should be used in the Preface section. Although the Title Page is the
first page of the Preface, no number is printed on it. Numbering begins on the second page with (ii).
Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3) are used on the pages of the text (starting with the introduction page)
and supplementary sections.

#### 4.7 Footnotes

There are differences in the use of footnotes in various disciplines. For example, footnotes are
commonly used in the Social Sciences but rarely in Science and Technology. Footnotes should use a
smaller font than the text (font size 8). Please refer to the faculty for the recommended convention
for writing of footnotes.

#### 4.9 Tables

Tables are printed within the body of the text at the center of the frame and labelled according to
the chapter in which they appear. Thus, for example, tables in Chapter 3 are numbered sequentially:
Table 3.1, Table 3.2.
The label should be placed above the table itself and has the following format:
Table 3.1: Short Title
If the table occupies more than one page, the continued table on the following page should indicate
that it is a continuation: for example: „Table 3.7, continued‟. If the table contains a citation, the
source of the reference should be placed below the table.

#### 4.10 Figures

Figures, like tables are printed within the body of the text at the center of the frame and labeled
according to the chapter in which they appear. Thus, for example, figures in Chapter 3 are
numbered sequentially: Figure 3.1, Figure 3.2.
Figures, unlike text or tables, contain graphs, illustrations or photographs and their labels are placed
at the bottom of the figure rather than at the top (using the same format used for tables).
If the figure occupies more than one page, the continued figure on the following page should
indicate that it is a continuation: for example: „Figure 3.7, continued‟.
If the figure contains a citation, the source of the reference should be placed at the bottom, after the
label.

## 5. MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION

### 5.1 Bibliography

The use of the American Psychological Association (APA) parenthetical citation system is highly
recommended by the University.

#### 5.2 Units of Measurement

The International System of Units (SI) must be used for all scientific and laboratory data. If other
units of measurement are used, they need to be converted to SI units and placed in parenthesis.

#### 5.3 Research Ethics

Research Ethics involves all the moral and professional issues relating to research. The most serious
breach of ethical standards in writing research report/dissertation/thesis is the offence of plagiarism:
the expropriation of the intellectual property of another. Plagiarism is defined as the use of original
work, ideas or actual texts created by others, without acknowledging the original source. Such
acknowledgement should be made by:
(i) including the source in the bibliography; and/or
(ii) including the citation by acknowledging the source in the text.
