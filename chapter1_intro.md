# Chapter 1: Introduction

This chapter introduces the research context, problem statement, and objectives of this thesis on anomaly-based fraud detection in banking transactions using deep learning and Apache Spark. It provides an overview of the research methodology, expected outcomes, and the structure of the thesis.

## 1.1 Background and Motivation

Financial fraud has emerged as one of the most significant challenges facing the banking industry today. With global losses from fraudulent activities reaching approximately $28.65 billion in 2023 alone (PwC Global Economic Crime Survey, 2024), the financial impact on institutions and consumers continues to escalate at an alarming rate. Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems, while effective for known patterns, struggle to identify novel and evolving fraud schemes that adapt to circumvent established security measures.

The digitalization of banking services has dramatically increased the volume, velocity, and variety of financial transactions, creating both opportunities and challenges for fraud detection. On one hand, this digital transformation has generated unprecedented amounts of data that can potentially reveal subtle patterns of fraudulent behavior. On the other hand, it has expanded the attack surface for fraudsters, who continuously develop sophisticated techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in financial systems.

The motivation for this research stems from three critical observations in the current financial security landscape:

1. **Increasing sophistication of fraud techniques**: Modern fraudsters employ advanced techniques such as synthetic identity fraud, account takeover attacks, and transaction laundering that often bypass traditional detection methods. These techniques evolve rapidly, requiring equally dynamic detection mechanisms.

2. **Limitations of rule-based systems**: Conventional fraud detection systems rely heavily on predefined rules and thresholds established by domain experts. While effective for known fraud patterns, these systems lack the flexibility to adapt to new fraud schemes without significant manual intervention. Additionally, they often generate high rates of false positives, creating operational inefficiencies and potentially alienating legitimate customers.

3. **Untapped potential of advanced analytics**: Despite the availability of vast transaction data and advanced computational techniques, many financial institutions have yet to fully leverage the potential of big data analytics and machine learning for fraud detection. The gap between theoretical advances in anomaly detection and their practical implementation in banking systems represents a significant opportunity for research and innovation.

This research is motivated by the urgent need to develop more sophisticated, adaptive, and accurate fraud detection systems that can effectively protect financial institutions and their customers in an increasingly complex threat landscape. By combining the scalability of big data technologies with the pattern recognition capabilities of deep learning, this thesis aims to contribute to the next generation of fraud detection solutions for the banking sector.
