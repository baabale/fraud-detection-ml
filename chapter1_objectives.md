## 1.7 Research Objectives

This research aims to develop and evaluate a comprehensive fraud detection framework that leverages deep learning techniques and Apache Spark to address the challenges identified in the problem statement. The specific objectives are:

1. **Design and implement a scalable data processing pipeline** using Apache Spark that can efficiently handle large volumes of banking transaction data, supporting both batch processing for model training and stream processing for real-time fraud detection.

2. **Develop and evaluate deep learning models** for anomaly-based fraud detection, focusing on both supervised classification approaches for known fraud patterns and unsupervised techniques for detecting novel fraud schemes.

3. **Address the class imbalance problem** in fraud detection through advanced sampling techniques, specialized loss functions, and model architectures designed for imbalanced datasets.

4. **Create an effective feature engineering framework** that extracts relevant temporal, behavioral, and transactional features from raw banking data to improve fraud detection performance.

5. **Implement techniques for model adaptability** to address concept drift and evolving fraud patterns over time, including drift detection mechanisms and model updating strategies.

6. **Establish comprehensive evaluation protocols** that go beyond traditional accuracy metrics to assess the practical effectiveness of fraud detection models in banking environments, incorporating business impact metrics and operational considerations.

7. **Provide guidelines and best practices** for implementing deep learning-based fraud detection systems in production banking environments, addressing technical integration challenges and operational requirements.

These objectives are designed to produce actionable research outcomes that contribute both to academic knowledge in anomaly detection and to practical fraud prevention capabilities in the banking sector.
